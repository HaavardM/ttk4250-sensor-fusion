\subsubsection{Computational Performance of EKF-SLAM}
EKF-SLAM has been critizised for a variety of reasons in the literature, and one of the issues often brought up is computational performance as the map grows large. In fact, each timestep of EKF-SLAM has a computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in the number of detected landmarks. \cite{divideandconq} Our implementation, when tuned to provoke lots of landmark detections (around 800) resulted in the update step of the Kalman filter taking quadratic time, as shown in figure \ref{fig:update_time_landmarks}. These results show that in large environments, EKF-SLAM alone fails to meet the time-requirements for online SLAM.
