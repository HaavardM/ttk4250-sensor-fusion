\subsection{Victoria Park Dataset}
When tuning for the Victoria Park dataset we initialized the filter with the standard deviations found using the simulated dataset. We used the same normalized NIS as we did in \cref{a3-sim-tuning} and tried to get as consistent results as possible by targeting the amount of NIS within our $95\% \chi^2$ CI. The provided GPS measurements was missing large gaps of data, and due to the low precision in raw GPS measurements we argue it is not good enough to be used as ground truth. NEES is therefore considered unavailable. As shown in \cref{fig:results_bg}, we overlayed a picture from google maps over our track and aligned the landmarks as best as we could. By considering the visual overlay and NIS we tuned our filter to get as precise results as possible while still getting a consistent filter. Our finished tuning resulted in $37\%$ within the NIS CI and is often.
