\section{Conclusion}
During this course we have used the IMM-PDAF approach for tracking a boat through tight turns, using only a radar mounted on a nearby ship. We have also developed an ESKF that is able to estimate the 6 degrees of freedom for an airplane using inertial navigation. We have also implemented the EKF-SLAM approach for solving the \texttt{Simultanious Localization And Mapping} problem using a lidar scanner and odometry measurement. Throughout the course we have also used metrics such as NEES and NIS to quantify our implementations ability to be consistent, while also tuning our filters to be precise.
