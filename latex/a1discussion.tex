\subsubsection{Discussion}
We also tested with the much simpler CV and CT PDAF models to compare results. Both the CT and CV EKF PDAF models worked suprisingly well on the dataset and they were much simpler to tune. We even got a higher proportion of NEES within our CI, but with a small increase in tracking error (RMSE). This makes sense since the simpler models are easier to get consistent, but with a loss in tracking precision.
