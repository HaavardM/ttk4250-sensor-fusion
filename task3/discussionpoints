* computation time of ekfslam increases with number of landmarks
* jcbb takes a long time
* ekf has a tendency to become overoptimistic
* lots of the landmarks that are registered are cars!
    * they are constantly moving, thereby breaking the landmark assumptions
    * we add all unassociated measurements as new landmarks and never remove any again

* It is known that in the limit of SLAM, all x-coordinates and all y-coordinates become fully correlated (Dissanayake et al. 2001). https://jinyongjeong.github.io/images/post/SLAM/lec09_SEIF_SLAM/SEIF.pdf
* PDAF can be used to better reject clutter measurements
    * IPDA has a concept of target existance, i.e. we can let spurious landmarks "die"

* Way to improve both consistency and computational cost of EKF-SLAM: local maps
    * "The use of local maps has been demonstrated to be useful in these situations, reducing computational cost and improving map consistency."
